# `checkmk_alert`

## Description üñºÔ∏è

`checkmk_alert` is a system for sending alerting emails via a local SMTP server when an anomaly is observed into the Checkmk's dashboard with servers statuses. In this context, an anomaly consists in an exceeding of a set threshold by the number of down hosts (considering only the ones mentioned in a list of relevant or all not mentioned in a list of ignored ones).
