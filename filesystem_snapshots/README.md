## Setup üîß

1. Install Python 3.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add an authorized key on the remote server to avoid the password prompting on each baseline creation (*optional*).
4. Insert a new line in the configuration file `configuration/ignored_paths.txt` for each file (for example, folders containing log files continuously changing) that needs to be ignored in the processing (*optional*).

## Usage üß∞

In the commands below, the IP address of the remote server is noted with `IP`, and the user used for login with `USER`.

1. Create a baseline snapshot: `./filesystem_snapshots.sh baseline IP USER`.
2. Create a new snapshot and compare it with the baseline one: `./filesystem_snapshots.sh compare IP USER`.
